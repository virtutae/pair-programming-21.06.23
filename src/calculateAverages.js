/*
### Task:

Write a function which takes an array of numbers and returns the two separate averages of negative numbers and positive numbers found in the array.

Return the averages as two elements of an array, or, if you know objects, as properties `averageOfPositives` and `averageOfNegatives`

Use the value `null` to indicate when an average is not possible - e.g. when there are no positive numbers.

Zero values are not positive or negative. You should exclude them from your calculations.

### Example:

`calcAveragesNegativeAndPositive([10, -100, 20, -200, -3])` 
should return either the array

 `[15, -101]`

*or* the object

`{ averageOfPositives: 15, averageOfNegatives: -101 }`

where *`15`* is the average of all the positive numbers (10, 20)  and *`-101`* is the average of all the negative numbers (-100, -200, -3)
